# PRS for bladder cancer cancer in European population

- Goal  
The goal of the study is to build polygenic risk score (PRS) for bladder cancer in European population.  
- Data  
This is a large-scale study including GWAS summary data and/or individal genotype data from nine study/array groups, such as Spanish Bladder Cancer EPICURO Study (SBCS), European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition Study (EPIC),Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC),New England Bladder Cancer Study (NEBCS), Nijmegen Bladder Cancer Study (NBCS), Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncol√≥gicas (CNIO), DeCode Genetics, and others using individual genotypes from six genotyping platforms (llumina Human 1M Duo, Illumina Human 660W-Quad, Illumina Human 610-Quad, Illumina 2.5M, OncoArray, and Infinium OmniExpress).
